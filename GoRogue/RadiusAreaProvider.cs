	/// <remarks>
	/// In the case that MANHATTAN/CHEBYSHEV distance, or DIAMOND/SQUARE/OCTAHEDRON/CUBE radius shapes
	/// are used, positions returned are guaranteed to be returned in order of distance from the center,
	/// from least to greatest. This guarantee does NOT hold if EUCLIDEAN distance, or CIRCLE/SPHERE radius
	/// shapes are specified. If no bounds are specified, the IEnumerable returned by the
	/// <see cref="CalculatePositions"/> function will contain each coordinate within the radius. Otherwise, it
	/// will contain each coordinate in the radius that is also within the bounds of the rectangle. If the same
	/// radius length is being used multiple times (even from different center points), it is recommended to use
	/// only one RadiusAreaProvider, as the class allocates measurable memory, and using only one instance
	/// if the radius is used multiple times prevents reallocation. When the Radius value is
	/// changed, reallocation must be performed, however the overhead should be insignificant on
	/// everything but extremely large radiuses.
