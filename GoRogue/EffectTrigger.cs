    /// Represents an "event" that can automatically trigger and manage one or more

    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// EffectTrigger's primary purpose is to represent an event that can trigger one or more effects, and
    /// automatically remove those effects from the list when their duration reaches 0.  Each EffectTrigger
    /// instance can have one or more (non-instantaneous) effects added to it. All Effects must take the same
    /// type of argument to their <see cref="Effect{TriggerArgs}.Trigger(TriggerArgs)"/>
    /// function, as specified by this class's type parameter.
    ///
    /// Each time the <see cref="TriggerEffects(TTriggerArgs)"/> function is called, every Effect has its
    /// Trigger function called (provided its duration is not 0). Each Effect may, via the TriggerArgs
    /// <see cref="EffectArgs.CancelTrigger"/> member, stop the effect from
    /// being sent to subsequent effects in the EffectTrigger's list. Once either all effects in the list
    /// have had their Trigger function called, or some effect has cancelled the triggering, any effect
    /// whose duration has reached 0 is removed from the EffectTrigger automatically.
    /// 
    /// Typically, one instance of this class is created per "event" that can trigger effects, and then the
    /// instance's TriggerEffects function is called whenever that event happens. For example, in a
    /// typical roguelike, all damageable creatures might have an instance of this class called
    /// OnDamageTakenEffects. Any effect that should trigger when that creature takes damage would then be
    /// added to that creature's OnDamageTakenEffects EffectTrigger. The TakeDamage function of that
    /// creature would then need to call OnDamageTakenEffects.TriggerEffects(...). In this way, all effects
    /// added to the OnDamageTakenEffects EffectTrigger would be triggered automatically whenever the
    /// creature takes damage.
    ///
    /// For some complex game mechanics, it may be desireable to control how effects stack, the order they appear
    /// in the effects list of EffectTriggers, etc. In these cases, subclassing EffectTrigger and overriding the
    /// add and remove functions can allow this functionality.
