	/// Like most GoRogue algorithms, AStar takes as a construction parameter an IMapView representing the map. 
	/// Specifically, it takes an <see cref="IMapView{Boolean}"/>, where true indicates that a tile should be
	/// considered walkable, and false indicates that a tile should be considered impassable.
	/// 
	/// For details on the map view system in general, see <see cref="IMapView{T}"/>.  As well, there is an article
	/// explaining the map view system at the GoRogue documentation page
	/// <a href="https://chris3606.github.io/GoRogue/articles">here</a>
	/// 
	/// If truly shortest paths are not strictly necessary, you may want to consider <see cref="FastAStar"/> instead.
