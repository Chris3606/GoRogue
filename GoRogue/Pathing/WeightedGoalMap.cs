	/// Implementation of the second half of the goal map system described in
	/// <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Power_of_Dijkstra_Maps">this article</a> --
	/// the ability to combine multiple goal maps with different weights.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// This class encapsulates the work of building one overall goal map out of multiple existing
	/// maps. It holds references to one or more maps, each with its own "weight". The higher the
	/// weight value, the more strongly an AI will attempt to pursue this goal. A negative weight
	/// inverts the map, turning its goal into something to avoid.  Inverting the weight does not
	/// create a "safety map" as described in the article, as the resulting goal map will show no
	/// concept of global vs. local avoidance.  For that functionality, see <see cref="FleeMap"/>.
	/// </remarks>
