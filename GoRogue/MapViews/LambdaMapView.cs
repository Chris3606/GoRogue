	/// <summary>
	/// Class designed to make implementing simple IMapViews more convenient, by providing the "get"
	/// functionality via a function that is passed in at construction. For a version that
	/// implements <see cref="ISettableMapView{T}"/> as opposed to <see cref="IMapView{T}"/>, see
	/// <see cref="LambdaSettableMapView{T}"/>.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Despite actual game map representations often consisting of complex types, exposing certain
	/// properties as primitive types (via IMapView implementations) for GoRogue algorithms to use is
	/// often fairly simple (simply exposing a property in the actual map class, or similar). If your
	/// map consists of cells of some sort, where there exists an instance of some class/struct per
	/// location that contains information about that location, TranslationMap/LambdaTranslationMap
	/// provide convenient ways to implement simple IMapViews. In the case that no such single type
	/// exists, however, a more generic IMapView implementation is needed. This class takes the "get"
	/// function as a function to shorten the process of creating such an implementation.
	/// </remarks>
