    /// such, this interface extends IMapView to provide the capability to "set" values
    /// 
    /// Like IMapView, a number of implementations of this interface to cover common cases are provided.  For example,
    /// in case an actual array is desired, <see cref="ArrayMap{T}"/> implements this interface for you via an actual
    /// array. Similarly, <see cref="LambdaSettableMapView{T}"/> implements the interface for you via a function you
    /// pass to it.

        /// the value associated with the position.
