	/// <summary>
	/// Interface common to spatial map implementations provided with GoRogue, which are designed
	/// to be a convenient way to store items that reside on a map.  TLDR; If you're about
	/// to use a List to store all the objects on a map, consider using a (GoRogue-provided) ISpatialMap
	/// implementation instead.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Typical roguelikes will use a 2D array (or 1D array accessed as a 2D array), for terrain, and
	/// lists of objects for things like entities, items, etc. This is simple but ultimately not
	/// efficient; for example, in that implementation, determining if there is an object at a
	/// location takes an amount of time proportional to the number of objects in this list. However,
	/// the other simple option is to use an array with size equal to the size of the map (as many do
	/// for terrain) for all object lists. This is even less ideal, as in that case, the time to
	/// iterate over all objects becomes proportional to the size of the map (since one has to do
	/// that for rendering, that's bad!), which is typically much larger than the number of objects in a
	/// list. This is the problem spatial map implementions are designed to solve. They provide fast,
	/// near-constant-time operations for getting the item(s) at a location, adding items, and removing
	/// items.  As well, they allow you to iterate through all objects in the spatial map in time
	/// proportional to the number of objects in it (the best possible). Effectively, it is a more efficient
	/// list for objects that have a position associated with them.  Spatial maps also provide events for when
	/// things are added, removed, etc., to allow you to conveniently respond to those types of actions.
	/// 
	/// Spatial maps have to keep track of the position of each item in them in order to provide
	/// their fast-lookup functionality.  Spatial maps can be used as the primary authority for what an item's
	/// position is in some cases -- however, in many cases, this may be undesireable, particularly when interfacing
	/// with more traditional infrastructures from other libraries, which likely record each item's position as a field
	/// or property of the item itself.  In these cases, where the item itself records its position, you will need to
	/// call the <see cref="Move(T, Point)"/> function (or a similar overload) whenever an object moves, to keep the
	/// spatial map's position for that item in sync with its actual position.
	/// 
	/// It is also worthy of note, that some implementations of ISpatialMap (such as <see cref="SpatialMap{T}"/>) have implemented
	/// <see cref="Move(T, Point)"/> in such a way that it could fail in some cases.  Move will return false in cases where it
	/// fails, so if you are using an implementation where that may happen, you may need to check this to avoid desync issues.
	/// The Move function documentation for each implementation clearly states in what cases a call to Move can fail.
