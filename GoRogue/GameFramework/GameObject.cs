    /// Base class for any object that has a grid position and can be added to a <see cref="Map"/>.  Implements basic attributes generally common to all objects
    /// on a map, as well as properties/methods that the Map class needs to function.  It also implements <see cref="IHasComponents"/>, which means you can attach
    /// components to it.  In cases where this class cannot be inherited from, have your class implement <see cref="IGameObject"/> via a private GameObject field.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This class is designed to serve as a base class for your own game objects in your game.  It implements basic common functionality such as
    /// walkability and transparency, provides some infrastructure that allows it to be added to instances of <see cref="Map"/>, and implements the
    /// framework for GoRogue's component system.  It also implements the necessary functionality that allows GameObjects to be added to an
    /// <see cref="ISpatialMap{T}"/> implementation.
    /// 
    /// Generally, you would create one or more classes (say, MyGameObject or MyTerrain), that derives from this one (GameObject), or implement
    /// <see cref="IGameObject"/> by composition using a private field of this class, and use that as
    /// the base class for your game's objects.  There is an example of doing this <a href="https://chris3606.github.io/GoRogue/articles/game-framework.html#implementing-igameobject">here</a>.
    /// If you utilize the component system, a subclass of GameObject isn't strictly necessary, as you could just construct basic GameObject instances and add
    /// components to them.  In either case, a <see cref="Map"/> instance can be used to store these objects efficiently. As well, Map provides functionality that will allow you to retrieve your
    /// objects as references of their derived type (MyGameObject or MyTerrain, in the example above), meaning that you can implement any common, game-specific functionality you need and have
    /// easy access to that information when objects are retrieved from the map.  This also means that if you prefer an inheritance-based approach, you can simply not utilize
    /// the component system, and you are still able to use these Map functions to differentiate functionality.
    /// 
    /// Although the component system will accept items of any type as components, there is an optional <see cref="IGameObjectComponent"/> interface that GoRogue provides,
    /// that has a field for the parent, eg. the IGameObject that it is attached to.  This field is automatically kept up to date as you add/remove components
    /// if you implement this interface for your components.
