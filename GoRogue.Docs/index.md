# Welcome To GoRogue
Welcome to the GoRogue documentation!  This documentation consists of how-to guides to help you understand and get started with various features, as well as the API documentation for GoRogue.

# Utilizing the Documentation
The [Articles](~/articles/intro.md) tab is a good place to start, as it provides some conceptual information for the library, some getting started instructions, as well as how-to's for various features of GoRogue.  As you start to use one or more features, you may also want to check out the [API Documentation](~/api/index.md) for that feature -- it will give specifics on all the functionality provided by a given structure.

# Getting Help
If you run into a bug or general question regarding the usage a feature, or otherwise want to suggest a feature/improvement, there are a few methods:

## GoRogue Issues Repository
For bug reports and feature suggestions, feel free to create an issue on the [GitHub Issues Repository](https://github.com/Chris3606/GoRogue/issues).

## SubReddit
GoRogue has its own subreddit at [r/goroguelib](https://www.reddit.com/r/goroguelib).  Feel free to post there with general questions, suggestions for the library, etc.

## Discord
GoRogue also has its own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fxj5kPq)!. Feel free to stop by with issues or questions.  Additionally, for [SadConsole](https://github.com/SadConsole/SadConsole/) users, SadConsole's discord does have a gorogue-integration channel that can be useful for getting questions answered or problems solved -- I also frequently check this discord, so if you're using SadConsole, feel free to post there with issues or questions as well.
