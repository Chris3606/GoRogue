# GoRogue Documentation
Welcome to the GoRogue documentation!  This documentation consists of some articles on various features to help you understand and get started with those features, as well as the API documentation for GoRogue.

# Utilizing the Documentation
The [Articles](~/articles/intro.md) tab is a good place to start, as it provides some conceptual information for the library, some getting started instructions, as well as articles on the various features of GoRogue.  As you start to use one or more features, you may also want to check out the [API Documentation](~/api/index.md) for that feature -- it will give specifics on all the functionality provided by a given structure.

# Getting Help
If you run into a bug or general question regarding the usage a feature, or otherwise want to suggest a feature/improvement, there are a few methods:

## GoRogue Issues Repository
For bug reports and feature suggestions, feel free to create an issue on the [GitHub Issues Repository](https://github.com/Chris3606/GoRogue/issues).

## SubReddit
GoRogue has its own subreddit at [r/goroguelib](https://www.reddit.com/r/goroguelib).  Feel free to post there with general questions, suggestions for the library, etc.

## Discord
GoRogue (currently) does not have its own Discord server.  However, for [SadConsole](https://github.com/SadConsole/SadConsole/) users, SadConsole's discord does have a gorogue-integration channel that can be useful for getting questions answered or problems solved -- I frequently check this discord, so if you're using SadConsole, feel free to post there with issues or questions as well.
