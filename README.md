## Documentation
Instructions for getting started with GoRogue, articles detailing its features, and the API documentation can be found on the [documentation website](https://chris3606.github.io/GoRogue/index.html). In addition to being on the website, the API documentation show up in Visual Studio as normal.  GoRogue also has a subreddit at [r/GoRogueLib](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoRogueLib/).

The GitHub wiki also contains articles, but these are outdated and are currently in the process of being moved to the above documetation website.

## Feature List
### .NET Standard 2.0 Compatibility
   - Library will function with any framework that supports .NET Standard 2.0, which includes both .NET Framework and .NET Core.
   
### Unobtrusive Algorithms
- FOV, Lighting/SenseMapping, and Map Generation algorithms operate on an abstract interface (IMapView), thus allowing the features to be used without imposing limitations and how/where data is actually stored within the game.
- Convenient default implementations of the IMapView interface is provided, to allow for ease of use in straightforward cases or during prototyping:
   - ArrayMap implements IMapView and stores data in a 2D array for cases when a simple/straightforward IMapView implementation is needed.
   - Classes that allow supplying "translation" functions as lambdas or delegates for simple cases are also provided.
  
### Coordinate/Grid System
- Coord class provides a way to store 2D grid (integer) coordinates:
   - Pooling is used to allow extensive use without significant allocation and memory overhead.
   - Numerous operators are provided to allow for seamless addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of Coord instances, as well as addition/subtraction/multiplication/division by constants.
    - Static flag provided for whether Y-values decrease or increase in the downward direction, so that such functions can be used regardless of what coordinate scheme is being used.
   - Functions are provided to perform utility functions such as determining the bearing of a line, as well as retrieval of all points on a given line (via Brensham's), or cardinal line.
   - Also provides methods that implement other mathmematical grid functions, including midpoint formula, and translation of 2D coordinates to a 1D array index and back.
   - Provides hashing function that has a very low collision rate, particularly when considering coordiates between (-3, -3) and (255, 255).
- Direction class pairs with Coord to provide convenient ways to model movement to adjacent grid coordinates, as well as iterations through adjacent "neighbors" of a given location in both 4-way and 8-way movement schemes:
   - Directions can be added to Coord instances to get the Coord directly adjacent to the original, in the direction specified.
   - Methods that generation IEnumerables of neighboring directions in various orders are provided.
   - Functions are given to determine direction most closely matching a line between two points.
- Distance class models 2D distance calculations in an abstract way, allowing algorithms to function no matter which distance calculation is being used:
   - Manhattan, Chebyshev, and Euclician distance calculations are implemented.
- Radius type models the radius shapes assumed by above distance calculations:
   - Explicitly castable to Distance types and back.
   - RadiusAreaProvider class allows the easy retrieval of all coordinates within a defined radius (and optionally a bounding box).
- Rectangle class represents a rectangular area on a 2D grid, and provides useful operations for such areas:
- ISpatialMap implementations provide storing of object(s) at a given location in an efficient way:
   - Provides average-case constant time lookup of object(s) at a location.
   - Retrieval of all objects in the SpatialMap in linear time (equivalent efficiency to vector).
   - Less memory overhead than storing objects in 2D array.

### Random Number Generation
- Provides easy to use random number generators, that wrap around the C# default RNGs, as well as create custom distributions:
   - DotNetRandom provides a wrapper around the default C# RNG that implements the IRandom interface.
   - GaussianRandom implements an RNG that returns numbers on a bell curve, with the capability to specify min and max values.
   - IRandom implementations intended for testing are provided, to allow for easier unit testing/debugging of functions that use RNGs:
      - KnownSeriesRandom returns a specified series of numbers (looping through).
      - MaxRandom always returns the max parameter specified to the Next function.
      - MinRandom always returns the min parameter specified to the Next function.
- SingletonRandom provides a static field that can be used to conveniently set the default RNG that functions needing RNGs will use if a particular one is not specified.

### Dice Notation Parser
- Provides a system for parsing expressions in Dice notation format, and rolling those dice using the library's provided number generators.
- Expression objects are provided to avoid expensive parsing operations every time a roll is completed.

### Map Generation
- Map generation algorithms operate on MapView<bool> types, to avoid intrusiveness.
- Algorithms are modularized, as to provide maximum reuse:
   - Generation and connectivity algorithms are seperated to provide maximum flexibility.
   - Different common components of connectivity algorithms are also separated.
   - In all these cases, reasonable defaults are provided to prevent the addition of unnecessary complexity to simple/prototyping cases.
- Various methods of generation are provided:
   - RectangleMapGenerator generates a simple rectangle, with walls along the edges, and floor elsewhere.
   - RandomRoomsGenerator generates a dungeon with multiple rectangular, connected rooms. Number of rooms, as well as size ranges for rooms and maximum number of tries to place a room, is parameterized.
   - CellularAutomataGenerator generates a dungeon using the cellular automata smoothing process detailed [here](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Cellular_Automata_Method_for_Generating_Random_Cave-Like_Levels).
- MapArea and MapAreaFinder provide convenient ways of representing arbitrarily-shaped sections of the map, and locating all such distinct regions.

### FOV/Lighting/Sense Mapping
- LOS class offers fairly standard 2D FOV using shadowcasting:
   - FOV can be calculated in any of several shapes (modeled by Radius class instances).
   - Length of the radius can be specified, or infinite.
   - Resulting FOV is a lightmap -- an array of doubles in range \[0.0, 1.0], such that the value decreases from 1.0 proportionally as distance from the source increases.
   - Provides convenience fields to access only those (new) cells in/out of FOV.
- SenseMap/SenseSource pair to offer much more advanced FOV/lighting features:
   - RIPPLE algorithm can be used to model light spreading around corners, which allows locations to only partially block spread of light.
   - Sources may use either the RIPPLE algorithm variations, or shadowcasting, to model their spreading.
   - Tracks and calculates multiple, mobile light sources, in a multi-threaded manner, and consolidates them into a single light map.
   - SenseMap can also be used to model other sensory perceptions.
   
### Pathfinding
   - AStar pathfinding allows quick and efficient (shortest) paths between two points on a map.
      - Uses same MapView system as other algorithms to provide a convenient interface.
      
### Line Drawing
   - Provides functions implementing common-line drawing algorithms.
      - Bresenham's implementation
      - DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) implementation that produces very similar results to Bresenham's, but often faster.
      - Orthogonal line-drawing algorithm that creates steps that follow only cardinal directions.

### Robust Effects System
- Provides a system of representing both instant duration, and over-time "effects", with arbitrary duration units.
- EffectTrigger can be used to trigger effects at certain arbitrary points, automatically reducing their duration:
   - Effects can be canceled and have infinite duration.
   - Effects are automatically removed from an EffectTrigger when their duration expires.

### Utility
- Provides math functions to handle properly wrapping array/menu indices, radian-degree conversions, and wrapping to nearest multiples.
- Extension method provided for List that implements a Fisher-Yates shuffle.
- Extension methods for IList are provided to select either a random index or random value from an IList.
- Extension method provided for IEnumerable to convert the IEnumerable to a List.
- Provides basic integer-based DisjointSet data structure, that implements path compression.

## Roadmap
This library is still in development - there are a number of important features on the horizon! These include:
- Pathfinding Additions
   - AStar implementation supporting custom heuristics/weights
   - Dijkstra maps (commonly known as Goal Maps)
- Statistics Library
   - Utility classes to assist in dealing with interdependent character/monster statistics.
- Demo Project/writeup
- Map generation improvements
   - More map generation algorithms (BSP Tree).
   - Possibly improve RandomRoomsMapGenerator - change room placement strategy to be more even, or replace with BSP tree.
- Additional FOV Algorithms
   - Permissive-style FOV
   - Others?
